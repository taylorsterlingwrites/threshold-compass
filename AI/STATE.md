## Delegated (Waiting)

| Task | Agent | Sent At | Output Location |
|------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| None currently | | | |

## Blockers

- None! All core features built and Supabase connected.

---

## Decisions Made

1. **Auth:** Supabase Auth with email/password
2. **State:** Zustand for client state
3. **Offline:** Service worker for Drift Mode (pending)
4. **Mobile-first:** No desktop-specific layouts in v1
5. **Next.js 16:** Using @supabase/ssr (not deprecated auth-helpers)
6. **Suspense:** useSearchParams wrapped for build compatibility

---

## Next Actions

1. [x] Initialize Next.js project
2. [x] Copy pre-built files (types.ts, schema.sql, algorithms)
3. [x] Build UI component library
4. [x] Create dose/check-in API routes
5. [x] Connect carryover algorithm to compass display
6. [x] Push to GitHub (taylorsterlingwrites/threshold-compass)
7. [ ] **USER ACTION:** Create Supabase project
8. [ ] **USER ACTION:** Run schema.sql in SQL Editor
9. [ ] **USER ACTION:** Update .env.local with credentials
10. [ ] Test full auth flow end-to-end
11. [ ] Configure PWA service worker
12. [ ] Deploy to Vercel

## Pages Built

| Route | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `/login` | ✓ | Email/password login |
| `/signup` | ✓ | Registration with onboarding redirect |
| `/auth/callback` | ✓ | OAuth callback handler |
| `/compass` | ✓ | Home with LIVE carryover + dose history |
| `/log` | ✓ | Dose + check-in forms with API integration |
| `/drift` | ✓ | 4-7-8 breathing, 5-4-3-2-1 grounding, crisis |
| `/onboarding` | ✓ | 3-step intro |
| `/api/doses` | ✓ | POST/GET dose logs with carryover calc |
| `/api/check-ins` | ✓ | POST/GET check-ins |

---

## Notes

- Build passes with all TypeScript checks
- Middleware deprecation warning (Next.js 16 wants "proxy" - can ignore for now)
- Dev server runs on port 3003 (3000 in use)

---

## Resume Instructions

If starting a new session:

1. Read this STATE.md first
2. Check if Supabase credentials are in .env.local
3. If yes: Test auth flow, then continue to Phase 3
4. If no: Wait for user to create Supabase project
